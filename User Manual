Good Day, This is a simple guessing game. Popularly played during our childhood days.
The game is between the computer and a user. A user guesses the number a computer would pick randomly. If true you win, else you have lost.  
You first create an account from the accounts.py section to get registered. Proceed to the main.py file and input your username and password to get logged in. 
The rules governing the game would be displayed and input variables would be made clear. 

Enjoy!
